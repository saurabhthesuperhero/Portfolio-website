Hi, Welcome To SimplifyMindfulness

_Mindfulness for everyone_

My Dream is to make mindfulness easy for everyone as it is easy only not difficult as we already have made it.

I have covered and will cover many mental health-related issues like anxiety, depression, fear, overthinking and my aim is to let everyone be at peace of mind.

Mindfulness means maintaining a moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment, through a gentle, nurturing lens.

Mindfulness also involves acceptance, meaning that we pay attention to our thoughts and feelings without judging them—without believing, for instance, that there’s a “right” or “wrong” way to think or feel in a given moment. When we practice mindfulness, our thoughts tune into what we’re sensing in the present moment rather than rehashing the past or imagining the future.

I have tried my best to be able to bring out content that will make you escape from all your mental worry and sadness and be more mindful.
